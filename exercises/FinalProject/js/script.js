// I wanted to make a nicer way but I didnt manage to.

// Here is the first test of my second big part of code. I wanted a random post to appear every now and then to give some life to the BrutalBook website.
// The idea is that every x amount of time, jquery would append a new img in my div with the posts and would do so by creating an open div that would
// then have an attr associated to it that defined its source. This would mean I don't need same code multiple time but for some reason I can't make it work.
// var interval = an amount of time but I want that to change every x amount of time
// var otherPosts = ["pics/audreypost.png","pics/blank.png","pics/charles.png","pics/mass.png"];
// var numPosts = 4;
// var i =Math.floor((Math.random()*10)) % otherPosts.length
// var testDiv = $('<img class="drawnPosts" id="drawnPosts">');
// $('.make').append(testDiv);
// $('#drawnPosts').attr("src", otherPosts[i]);

// Here I am trying to see if i++ can make the posts post more than once, seeing that is the most I can do for now.
// var otherPosts = ["pics/audreypost.png","pics/blank.png","pics/charles.png","pics/mass.png"];
// var posts =Math.floor((Math.random()*10)) % otherPosts.length;
// var $newPostPics = $('<img class="drawnPosts" id="drawnPosts">');
// var i = 0
// var appendDiv = setInterval(function(){
//   if (i===4) {
//     clearInterval(appendDiv);
//   }
//   else {
//     console.log(i);
//   $(".make").append($newPostPics)
//   $("#drawnPosts").attr("src", otherPosts[posts]);
// }
// i++
// },5000)

// Here I was trying to count the time the posts were appended. The var interval would have been changed with my random time one.
// var $newPostPics = $('<img src="pics/frame.png" class="drawnPosts">')
// var interval = 1000;
// setInterval(function() {
//    $('.make').append($newPostPics);
//    var timesAppended = 0;
//    timesAppended = timesAppended + 1;
// // console.log(timesAppended)
// },interval);

//Here I was trying to make a value of time that refreshed, so it felt more human and less here is a post every 5 seconds
// setInterval(function(getTime){
// var time = Math.random() * 30000;
// // console.log(time);
// },5000);
