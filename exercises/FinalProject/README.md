# BRUTALBOOK

By merging web interventions, design and illustration, this website hopes to create an un-easy comfort for all users so they recognize the familiar shapes they are encountering
but are allowed and encourage to question them. Possibly due to the large amount of time I have stared at this program myself, I have come to strongly doubt the pertinence of
facebook in my everyday routine and the meaningless posts shown here that repeat themselves are a large criticism of how redundant facebook truly is. While simple and bare, this
website is also meant to recreate the feeling of desperation a user might feel when constantly leaving facebook and returning shortly after with hopes of interesting news or
a friendly interaction never to be found. Comparable to being hungry and looking in the fridge multiple time, always hoping something new will appear that will justify the time spent looking.
