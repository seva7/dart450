    <h1 class="storyLine">So this is King Charles.<br></br>
      King Charles was a really good looking guy but you see, when he was young he discovered how to make funny faces and loved it. Because he liked it so much Charles tried to cross his eyes for as long as possible until one day he fell down while he was walking with his eyes crossed (ridiculous, I know) and that broke his optical nerve which left him with permanent cross eyes. All the other Kings started making fun of him and to try and teach the mean Kings a lesson, Charles wanted to get a sword to fight them. This was harder than he though because of his terrible eye sight until one day he heard of a misterious creature that live deep deep in the code regions of Brooklyn.</h1>

So after posting a few pics with the hashtag magician the unknown entity appeard. It told him in it's most robotic voice that to weild this magic sword, Charles would have to learn jQuery and spread the word throughout his kingdom and all the ones around him, to which Charles gladly agreed. The entity then stole a strand of the under the king's crown and ate it. Imediately after that he started to squeeze his body until...
